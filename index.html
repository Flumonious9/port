        I have started this project, because I have always wanted to help my peers and I succeed. <br>
        One thing that I have noticed ever since I was in 7th Grade was the fact that <br>
        everyone seemed to be addicted to their phones. I was curious to see if their was a <br>
        correlation between more screen time and lower GPA. This curiosity eventually lead me <br>
        to wanting to know more about social media specifically.
        <br>
        <br>
        This year, I have given out some surveys and did some reaserch regarding social medias affect <br>
        on mental health, and on Student Academic Success. This survey was sent out around March 2nd, 2025. <br>
        Through this data, just based on my data, I have found that 50% of my school goes onto their phone <br>
        in class at least 1 time each day.
